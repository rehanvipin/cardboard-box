---
Lightweight boxes for development not just deployment.  
Boxes are meant for 'longer'-term usage than usual.  
Boxes are, in essence, containers.

## Goals
1. List all file-systems created on system
    > ~/.cbox/labels.json => user-provided names to tags
2. Install executable in /usr/local/bin
    > Default install in GOPATH
3. Add utilities
    > Rename boxes, Boot up particular boxes and purge
4. Document usage

## Requirements
* Go v1.14+
* amd64 architecture
